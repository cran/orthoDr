\title{Partial Sliced Averaged Variance Estimation}
\usage{
pSAVE(x, a, r, ndr = 2, nslices0 = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix for features (continuous only).}

\item{a}{A vector of observed dose levels (continuous only).}

\item{r}{A vector of reward (outcome).}

\item{ndr}{The dimension structure}

\item{nslices0}{Number of slides used for save}
}
\value{
A list consisting of
\item{vectors}{The basis of central subspace, ordered by eigenvalues}
}
\description{
The partial-SAVE model. This model is correct only under very strong assumptions, the solution is used as the initial value in the orthoDr optimization.
