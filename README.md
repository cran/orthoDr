The goal of `orthoDr` is to use an orthogonality constrained optimization
algorithm to solve a variety of dimension reduction problems in the
semiparametric framework.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `orthoDr` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=orthoDr) with:

``` r
  install.packages("orthoDr")
```

## Implemented Methods

This package implements the orthogonality constrained (Stiefel manifold) optimization approach proposed by [Wen & Yin (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-012-0584-1). A drop-in solver `ortho_optim()` works just the same as the `optim()` function. Relying on this optimization approach, we also implemented a collection of dimension reduction models for survival analysis, regression, and personalized medicine.
